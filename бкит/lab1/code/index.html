        <span class="bold">TABLE 1.01:</span> A website's visual experience can
        be grouped into critical and non-critical categories. The latter are
        where CSS3 can be applied today.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've been bending the <span class="highlight">float</span> property to
        handle layout for years now. We've figured out how to get by with what
        we have, but a real layout engine is absolutely a necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, two of the three new CSS3 layout modules have yet to be
        implemented by any browser. They're still being worked out, and arguably
        are still confusing, difficult to grasp, and likely not the final
        solution we've been looking for. Most importantly, for something as
        important as layout, CSS3 just isn't the right tool. Yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the opposite end of the spectrum are non-critical events like
        interaction (hover, focus, form elements, browser viewport flexibility),
        and visual enhancements that result from those interactions (along with
        animation). It's far less crucial to match an identical experience
        between browsers for events like these, and that's why it's a perfect
        opportunity to apply certain portions of CSS3 here for browsers that
        support them now.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's atop these non-critical events where we'll be applying CSS3
        throughout the book, keeping the more important characteristics of the
        page intact for all browsers, regardless of their current CSS3 support.
