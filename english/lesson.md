## Abstract:

It suggests that dynamic maps don't provide users with information for navigation but navigate them algorithmically, while accumulating their data.

## Lay summary:

The authors of this paper argue that navigation apps facilitate and indeed materialize datafication - the transformation of both map users and territory into data.

## Digital cartography and the datafication of space

In this paragraph authors lay out the upsides on using dynamic maps instead of the static ones.

## The datafied spatial subject

This paragraph is about the influence of dynamic maps on human perception

## Discussion

The article argues that navigation apps’ dynamic maps represent an "accumulative cartography," where users are data sources fueling app-driven navigation that prioritizes time and economic imperatives over user autonomy in map interpretation.
